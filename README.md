Will Vanderploeg wvanderploeg@my.waketech.edu

I will be using this github account for my CTI class and and any other programs I make for wake tech classes

This is a test repsitory made to ensure I know the process of maing changes and uploading changes

I made the repository in github, then I went to github desktop, found my file in the directory and clicked the clone button and waited for it to download
